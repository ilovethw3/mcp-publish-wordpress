## Content Structure

### Headings Hierarchy
- **H1**: Article title (automatically generated from title field)
- **H2**: Main section headings
- **H3**: Subsection headings
- **H4-H6**: Use sparingly for deep hierarchies

Example:
```markdown
# Main Title (H1 - WordPress generates this)
## Introduction (H2)
### Key Concepts (H3)
#### Implementation Details (H4)
```

### Paragraph Structure
- Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences)
- Use line breaks between paragraphs
- Start with topic sentences
- End with transition sentences when needed

## Text Formatting

### Emphasis
- **Bold** for important terms and key points
- *Italic* for emphasis and foreign words
- `Code` for technical terms and commands
- ~~Strikethrough~~ for corrections or deprecated information

### Lists
**Unordered Lists:**
- Use for non-sequential items
- Keep items parallel in structure
- Limit to 7Â±2 items for readability

**Ordered Lists:**
1. Use for sequential steps
2. Number items consecutively
3. Use sub-lists when needed

### Code Blocks
Use fenced code blocks with language specification:

```python
def example_function():
    return "Hello, WordPress!"
```

```javascript
const greeting = () => {
    console.log("Hello, WordPress!");
};
```

## Links and References

### Internal Links
- Link to related content on your site
- Use descriptive anchor text
- Avoid "click here" or "read more"
- Example: [WordPress security best practices](internal-link)

### External Links
- Link to authoritative sources
- Open in new tab for external sites (WordPress handles this)
- Use rel="nofollow" for untrusted sources
- Example: [Official WordPress documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/)

## Images and Media

### Image Guidelines
- Use descriptive alt text for accessibility
- Optimize images for web (WebP format preferred)
- Include captions when helpful
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios

### WordPress Image Syntax
```markdown
![Alt text description](image-url "Optional caption")
```

## Special WordPress Features

### Shortcodes
WordPress supports shortcodes for special functionality:
- `[gallery]` for image galleries
- `[caption]` for image captions
- `[embed]` for media embeds

### Blocks (Gutenberg)
When using Gutenberg editor, content will be converted to blocks:
- Paragraphs become paragraph blocks
- Headings become heading blocks
- Code blocks become code blocks
- Lists become list blocks

## SEO Optimization

### Keyword Usage
- Include focus keyword in first paragraph
- Use keywords naturally throughout content
- Include related keywords and synonyms
- Avoid keyword stuffing

### Meta Information
- Write compelling meta descriptions (150-160 characters)
- Use focus keyword in meta description
- Include publication date and author information

## Content Categories and Tags

### Categories
- Use 1-2 primary categories
- Choose existing categories when possible
- Create new categories sparingly

### Tags
- Use 3-8 relevant tags
- Mix broad and specific tags
- Include both topic and format tags
- Examples: "tutorial", "wordpress", "beginners", "advanced"

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader Friendly
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Include alt text for images
- Use descriptive link text
- Maintain good color contrast

### Mobile Optimization
- Keep paragraphs short for mobile reading
- Use responsive images
- Ensure touch targets are adequate
- Test on mobile devices

## WordPress-Specific Markdown Extensions

### Table of Contents
```markdown
[TOC]
```

### WordPress Blocks
```markdown
<!-- wp:heading {"level":2} -->
## Section Title
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Paragraph content here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
```
